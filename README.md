# Transit Delay Dashboard and Predictor

- Aggregated publicly available bus and streetcar delay data between 2014 to 2019 (via open data Toronto) to discover trends in delay type, length of a delay, vehicle type, delay by year, delay by season and delay by hour.
- Used address provided from dataset to collect over 70k geolocations via open street maps and google maps api
- Used tableau to create an interactive dashboard which can be viewed in more detail here: https://public.tableau.com/profile/eramos4256#!/vizhome/TTCBusDelayEDA/Dashboard1

3. Prediction of delay type using ML and DL - attempted to build a model (using ML and DL) which predicts the type of delay that will occur given an hour, day, and geolocation of the vehicle
