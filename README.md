# TTCBusStreetcarDelayVisualization

I've aggregated publicly available bus and streetcar delay data between 2014 to 2019 (via open data Toronto) and created an interactive dashboard which demonstrates key metrics such as the type of delay, length of a delay, etc.

On top of this, I have attempted to build a model (using ML and DL) which predicts the type of delay that will occur given an hour, day, and geolocation of the vehicle.
