# TTCBusStreetcarDelayVisualization

I've aggregated publicly available bus and streetcar delay data between 2014 to 2019 (via open data Toronto) and created an interactive dashboard which demonstrates key metrics such as the type of delay, length of a delay, etc.

Brief file descriptions:
1. Combine bus with streetcar delay data - merges collected data, data wrangling, and retrieval of long/lat of indicated locations via open street map + google api for use in interactive dashboard
2. Tableau dashboard screenshot - interactive dashboard that I created using the merged bus and streetcar files
3. Prediction of delay type using ML and DL - attempted to build a model (using ML and DL) which predicts the type of delay that will occur given an hour, day, and geolocation of the vehicle
